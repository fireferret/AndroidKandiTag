# AndroidKandiTag
Objective: This application allows users to add friends based on their proximity and keep track of said friends' history of attended events. 
- Users will be able to check into their location (e.g. Coachella) which will be saved into a history of events attended. 
- Users will earn badges for attending special events and adding certain users. 
- Other users will be able to see your badges and history of attended events. 
- There will also be an upcoming events page that is updated frequently to showcase new events. 
- Users will also be able to message each other (these messages will not be saved and will only last 24 hrs)

There will be a total of four activities:
- Find: see nearby people and add them
- Found: see the profiles of other people and message them
- Connect: messages and public activity (posts) 
- Events: list of upcoming events with links to buy tickets
- Settings: settings for proximity (wifi and bluetooth must be enabled for proximity to work)

How do I sign up?
- you can sign up using an existing facebook account

How does the proximity work?
- Proximity uses a combination of wifi, bluetooth and celluar data to find peers (all three plus location should be kept running in order for KandiTag to best determine nearby peers)
