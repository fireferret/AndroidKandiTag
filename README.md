Objective: This application allows users to add friends based on their proximity and keep track of said friends' history of attended events. 
- Users will be able to check into their location (e.g. Coachella) which will be saved into a history of events attended. 
- Users will earn badges for attending special events and adding certain users. 
- Other users will be able to see your badges and history of attended events. 
- There will also be an upcoming events page that is updated frequently to showcase new events. 
- Users will also be able to message each other (these messages will not be saved and will only last 24 hrs)
